\b;Walkthrough
Locations of threee robots (x,y):
-275.56;-332.22,
190.77;141.92,
291;-111.

The wasps will take any titanium and nuclear cells and take it to ants, who will immediately destroy it.
There is a lone robot near one of the practice bots (one at 190.77;141.92), that will shoot anything on sight, and it's battery is full.
Its a non selctable tracked shooter.
There's also a discoverable tracked organic shooter and winged grabber on the map somewhere.
In the southeast corner of the map is a small encampment with some powet cells and working recharge station and power cell factory.
The practice bot (one at -275.56;-332.22) is in this encampment.
There is a minefield and the third bot (one at 291;-111) is in the center of it.

All the bots have little to no power so you need to provide battery in order to drive them to your ship.
Remember to protect your practice bots, as having one of them destroyed fails the mission.
