DEVELOPMENT NOTES:

RGB - ReinforcedGrabberBot model 2. DEVELOPED FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.

This little robot will surely revolutionize the colonization process.
We had some problems regarding last prototype. The dimensional units during production were not correctly converted from imperial to metrical system, which resulted in durability even lower than regular grabbers.

Fortunately, now we can guarantee, that massive damage threshold will help it to endure the vicious sandstorms, and hostile environment.
As we have said, a few more tests and we'll be ready for mass production, and we won't have to give up the colonization process!
We did not have the time to develop the software though, and the direct control drivers are not implemented. 

Previous version (RGB - ReinforcedGrabberRobot model 1) should be deactivated, discarded and utilized immediately as soon as this robot arrives at base Bravo 7 for testing.
