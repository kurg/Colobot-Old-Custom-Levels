\b;Walkthrough
There are two ways through this mission, one with subber and less shooters,
other is faster and riskier and involves more shooting.

First way - In the bay, underwater next to your starting location are two organic matter
The third one is in the valley of the wrecks, further on the other side of the bay (on the surface).
Watch out for the odd spider there!
The first black box is in the south-east lake near spiders, underwater.

Second way - The island to the north west, swarming with ants has both alien nest which provides organic matter,
and a black box. (Both on surface)

There's also some TNT (on surface) and uranium ore (underwater) on the map. 
In one of the bays there's also a Nuclear Cell underwater.
The uranium deposits are near lake where spiders reside, and where the ants reside (whole island).
