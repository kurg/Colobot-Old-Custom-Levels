\b;Walkthrough
First build a factory and a Sniffer. Look for Titanium and a ground power supply near your ship. 
Make use of Uranium ore on the surface. Some uranium ore can be also found underwater.
The great underground uranium deposit is on a plateau in the south west.
There are no wrecks on this map. 

Use a lab to discover organic cannon, and use it to clear the area.
Be wary though, these aliens are smarter than usual. They will target offensive robots and your character from a longer distance,
will try to avoid obstacles or being shot by not walking only in straight lines, and some of them will
also attack titanium cubes, or power cells on sight. They may also randomly change their nesting location.
