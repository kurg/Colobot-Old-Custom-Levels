\b;Alludo

A basic map for level designers. You can use it as a base to create your own level and share it, if you mention you used Alludo and add me (Simbax) to the credits.

Also, it is a perfect map for testing because of its simplicity and it's easy to modify.

\t;Description

* By default the whole map is flat and there is no water.
* Resources are shown by the color lights. They are in the corners.
* 1 grid == 1 square colometer
* `Me` and first bots are immortal.
* All buildings and bots are available.
* There is no living alien.
* There are all objects from the game in the south-east corner of the map. Warning: visiting the Museum can lag your game!

\t;Example modifications

* Ground texture

You can change the ground texture by modifying \c;levels/custom/alludo/level001/terra001.bmp\n; file in the folder where you installed the level. This file must be saved as \c;bmp\n; (24-bit bitmap). You should just save it without changing the format, if your graphics editor has that option.

\t;The End

The game never ends, however, there is a bug with TNT and mines, so you can die and after that the screen goes white and you can't do anything except quitting from the game. It's the game's bug, not the map's.
