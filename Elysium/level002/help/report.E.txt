\tab;Temperature:      12.3C
\tab;Atmosphere:       Nitrogen/Oxygen/Argon; 87% earth-normal
\tab;Wind:             2.0 mps
\tab;Titanium ore:     None

\s;-> SUBSOIL\c;
\tab;Energy:           Very little
\tab;                     This late into the evening, only one
\tab;                     of your solar collectors is still
\tab;                     functioning.
\tab;
\tab;Titanium ore:     Some
\tab;                     Two separate titanium ore sites have
\tab;                     been discovered; both are marked by
\tab;                     rocky patches on the ground above.
\tab;
\tab;Uranium ore:      Some
\tab;                     The swampy area at the head-waters
\tab;                     of the river in the north-west shows
\tab;                     some indications of localized
\tab;                     uranium deposits.

\s;-> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\c;
\tab;Detected:         Autonomous activity
\tab;  - Danger:       Unknown
\tab;                     Low-level activity is detected
\tab;                     throughout the contintent.  No
\tab;                     specific direction of motion has
\tab;                     been isolated.  Yet.
\tab;
\tab;Detected:         Underwater motion
\tab;  - Danger:       Elevated
\tab;                     Motion has been detected underwater.
\tab;                     It is possible that the native life-
\tab;                     forms are capable of travelling
\tab;                     unharmed underwater.  Attack may
\tab;                     therefore come from any direction.
