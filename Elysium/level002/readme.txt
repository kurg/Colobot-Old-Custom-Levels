Colobot - Elysium Add-on Levels
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These missions are intended for advanced colobot players who have already
defeated the game and are looking for a greater challenge.  You will be
required to think strategically and program your bots effectively in order
to defeat increasingly complex environments and alien life forms.

This .ZIP file contains the first two Elysium missions:

   Mission 1 is primarily a strategic test.  Your goal is guarded fiercely
   by an existing colony of ants, and you must find a way to hold the
   guard off long enough to establish a base behind their lines.  This
   mission will require about 3 hours of game play for a skilled Colobot
   player to complete.

   Mission 2 is a coding test: how effective a defense can you muster?
   All the resources you need are already at your disposal, but you have
   only about two minutes before the alien horde begins invasion of your
   camp.  The aliens all come by land, but they can cooperate with each
   other to attack targets: your defensive towers will not last long at all.
   Spend your little remaining time setting up your defenses--and they had
   better be automated, or you're dead.  It will not be possible to survive
   this mission for more than ten minutes unless you have a top-notch shooter
   program or two available.  Even so, you will need to devise new defensive
   strategies: use shielders, towers, sentries and aggressive guards in
   combination, or the mission cannot be completed successfully.

More Elysium levels are forthcoming shortly.
