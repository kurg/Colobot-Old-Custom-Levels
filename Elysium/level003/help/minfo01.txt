Initial scans available; scanning for uranium ore and alien life-forms continues.

\s;-> SURFACE\c;
\tab;Temperature:      22.8C
\tab;Atmosphere:       Nitrogen/Oxygen/Argon; 87% earth-normal
\tab;Wind:             0.0 mps
\tab;Titanium ore:     None
\tab;Uranium ore:      None

\s;-> SUBSOIL\c;
\tab;Energy:           Some
\tab;                     Solar energy collectors should
\tab;                     work at high altitudes.
\tab;
\tab;Titanium ore:     Some
\tab;                     As usual, look for small rocky
\tab;                     patches, indicating durable ore
\tab;                     exists beneath the surface.  One
\tab;                     such area is detected east of your
\tab;                     landing site, near the coast.
\tab;
\tab;Uranium ore:      Unknown

\s;-> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\c;
\tab;Detected:         Autonomous activity
\tab;  - Danger:       Not immediate
\tab;                     Activity appears limited to the
\tab;                     region north of the river.  Be on
\tab;                     your guard.  There is something...
\tab;                     disturbing in the activity being
\tab;                     observed.  The native life forms
\tab;                     may prove less tractable than
\tab;                     others you have encountered.
\tab;
\tab;Detected:         Flight-hampering mist
\tab;  - Danger:       Inconvenience only
\tab;                     Mist appears non-corrosive, but has
\tab;                     electromagnetic properties that are
\tab;                     affecting your flight gear.  You'll
\tab;                     be grounded until the mist settles.
