\b;Programs dispatched by Mission Control
Mission Control has one additional program that may help you in this mission.

Initially your power requirements will be very high.  You can use the new FillCells program to keep all your batteries topped up.

Once you have built a Power Station, leave a bot running the FillCells program.  It will automatically look around for the least-charged battery, carry it up to the power station and return it to its original position when replenished.

This technique will allow your other bots to simply pick up any fresh battery and resume work, knowing that new fresh batteries will always be available.
